# Threat Model

Sharibo's README states what the ZK proof is doing and lists honest limitations. This document is the structured version: every property below names the code that enforces it, the test that exercises it, and the specific conditions under which it does *not* hold. Treat this as the canonical list of load-bearing guarantees — if a change touches any of the referenced code, this document should be updated in the same PR.

Scope: `contracts/sharibo/src/lib.rs`, `circuits/membership.template.circom`, `packages/client/`, and the demo entry points that call them (`scripts/e2e.ts`, `app/src/App.tsx`). Same scope as [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md).

## Assets

| Asset | What it means concretely |
|---|---|
| **The pot** | The token balance held by the contract for a circle's current round (`Circle.pot`), released in full to one `recipient` per `claim`. |
| **Member anonymity** | Given a successful claim, an observer should not learn *which* of the circle's members submitted the underlying proof. |
| **Round integrity** | Exactly one payout per funded round: no claim before the pot is fully funded, and no second payout from the same round's proof once one has already paid out. |

## Adversaries

| Adversary | Position | What they can see / do |
|---|---|---|
| **Outside chain observer** | Reads Horizon/RPC only, no keys, no circle membership. | Full public ledger state: `Circle` fields (`root`, `contribution`, `size`, `round`, `pot`, `contributors`), every `fund`/`claim` transaction's arguments and source account, event logs. Cannot see any member's `identityNullifier`/`identitySecret` or the mapping from a leaf to a real-world identity. |
| **Circle member** | Holds a valid `(identityNullifier, identitySecret)` leaf in the circle's tree. | Everything an outside observer sees, plus the ability to generate a real proof for their own leaf. Cannot forge a proof for another member's leaf (Merkle + Groth16 soundness) or replay their own proof into a later round (nullifier binding, see below). |
| **Circle admin** | Calls `create_circle`; address stored in `Circle.admin`. | Chooses `root`, `contribution`, `size`, and `vk` at creation time (`lib.rs:85-133`) — these are never revalidated by the contract afterward. Cannot block `fund` (only `from.require_auth()` is checked) or `claim` (no admin auth check at all — see `docs/adr/001-upgradeability.md:38-44`). Can call `cancel_circle` (`lib.rs:281-312`), which refunds the current round's contributors and permanently closes the circle. |
| **Contract deployer** | Deploys the Soroban WASM under the contract ID published in the README. | Controls the bytecode at deployment time only. `lib.rs` exposes no upgrade entry point, so post-deployment the deployer has no more power than any other observer (`docs/adr/001-upgradeability.md`, Decision §1). There is currently no published reproducible-build check, so a user must trust that the deployed WASM matches this repository's `contracts/sharibo/src/lib.rs` — this is a supply-chain gap, not a runtime one. |
| **Trusted-setup runner** | Ran the Powers-of-Tau + Groth16 setup that produced `circuits/verification_key.json` (`circuits/SETUP_TRANSCRIPT.md`, single contributor, 2025-07-01 entry). | If the setup's toxic waste was not destroyed, this party can construct a valid-looking proof for *any* circle using that vk without holding a real leaf in the tree at all — a full break of the membership property for those circles. This is the reason the setup is called out as single-party and non-production in [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md) and the README. |

## Security properties

### 1. Membership — "the claimant is a real, un-paid member"

**Mechanism.** The circuit's `MerkleTreeChecker` (`circuits/membership.template.circom:21-70`) constrains `Poseidon(identityNullifier, identitySecret)` to hash up to the declared `root` along a private path, with a booleanity constraint on each path index (`:45`) so a prover can't pick an out-of-range selector to fabricate an arbitrary hash input. The `Sharibo` template wires the private leaf into that check (`:99-110`). On-chain, `verify_groth16` (`lib.rs:339-368`) runs the real Groth16 pairing equation over BLS12-381 using Soroban's native `pairing_check`, against the `vk` stored on the `Circle` at creation.

**Tests.** `circuits/test/membership.test.js:74` (genuine member accepted), `:86` (wrong root rejected), `:92` (tampered path rejected), `:116` (non-boolean path index rejected). `contracts/sharibo/src/test.rs:194` (real proof accepted end-to-end), `:232` (tampered public input rejected — a real pairing failure, not a mock).

**Limits.**
- The verification key is supplied by whoever calls `create_circle`, per circle, and is never checked against a canonical hash on-chain (`lib.rs:85-93`). A circle admin who supplies a weak or malicious `vk` can make membership unverifiable or trivially satisfiable *for that circle* — the guarantee is only as strong as the vk the admin chose.
- If the trusted-setup toxic waste was not destroyed, the setup runner can forge a proof against the canonical vk regardless of tree contents (see Adversaries above).
- Poseidon-over-BLS12-381 constants come from a third-party package (`poseidon-bls12381`), cross-checked against Soroban's own field modulus but not independently audited — see README "Honest limitations".

### 2. No double claim — one payout per nullifier

**Mechanism.** `nullifierHash = Poseidon(identityNullifier, externalNullifier)` is emitted as a circuit output (`circuits/membership.template.circom:113-116`). The contract records it in `Circle.nullifiers` (`lib.rs`) and rejects any claim that reuses one, independent of the pairing check. Storing nullifiers inside the `Circle` persistent entry ensures nullifiers share the circle's continuously-extended TTL lifecycle and cannot be archived independently (see `docs/adr/004-storage-archival.md`).

**Tests.** `contracts/sharibo/src/test.rs` (`second_claim_with_same_nullifier_reverts`, `has_claimed_false_before_true_after`, `nullifier_fence_survives_ttl_expiry`).

**Limits.**
- `recipient` is a plain contract argument (`lib.rs`), not a circuit input — it is never bound to the proof (compare the circuit's signal list, `circuits/membership.template.circom:79-96`, which has no recipient signal at all; `circuits/test/membership.test.js:182` documents that the circuit does not bind the proof to any single expected value beyond what the verifier separately checks). Concretely: `(nullifier_hash, external_nullifier, proof)` is a valid claim for *any* `recipient`. If those values become visible before the original claim transaction is finalized — a careless or malicious relayer, or another party observing the pending transaction — anyone can resubmit the same tuple with a different `recipient` and redirect the payout. This is a payout-hijacking risk, not a privacy break: it costs the original claimant their payout, it does not deanonymize them. It's the same class of risk Tornado-Cash-style relayer designs address by adding the recipient (and a relayer fee) as a public input the circuit itself commits to; Sharibo does not do this today.
- In the demo, `claim` is always submitted through the admin's client (`scripts/e2e.ts:201`, `app/src/App.tsx:424,464`), which is exactly the delivery path where the above risk would surface first — the admin (or whoever holds that key) sees the proof and recipient before broadcasting and is a required relayer for the demo flow, even though `claim` itself has no `require_auth` call (`lib.rs`) and would accept submission from any account.
- Storage footprint per circle grows by `32 * N` bytes, bounded by the circle's size `N`.

### 3. Round binding — a proof for round *N* cannot be used in round *N+1*

**Mechanism.** `externalNullifier = SHA256(circle_id, round) mod r`, computed identically by the client (`packages/client/src/identity.ts:63-90`) and the contract (`lib.rs:325-331`), deliberately outside the circuit (Soroban has accelerated SHA-256 but no native Poseidon; see the comment at `lib.rs:314-324`). The contract compares the proof's public `external_nullifier` signal against its own freshly computed expectation for `circle.round` before accepting a claim (`lib.rs:207-211`).

**Tests.** `contracts/sharibo/src/test.rs:328` (`claim_reverts_on_stale_round_tag`); `circuits/test/membership.test.js:98` (nullifier hash changes across rounds for the same identity).

**Limits.**
- The circuit itself does **not** constrain `externalNullifier` to any particular value — it will happily produce a witness for any value passed in (`circuits/test/membership.test.js:163,172,182`). Round binding is entirely an on-chain equality check (`lib.rs:207-211`), not an in-circuit constraint. A proof is only "for round N" because the contract refuses to accept any other `external_nullifier`, not because the SNARK enforces it.
- `external_nullifier` is derived from SHA-256 rather than Poseidon, a deliberate permanent choice (see `lib.rs:314-324`) — soundness here rests on SHA-256 collision resistance, not the circuit's algebraic constraints.

### 4. Unlinkability — the payout address can't be tied to a funder

**Mechanism.** `claim` transfers the pot to whatever `recipient` address is passed (`lib.rs:236-237`); nothing in the contract or circuit requires `recipient` to have funded the circle or to have appeared before. The demo always generates a fresh keypair for this purpose (`scripts/e2e.ts`: "Generating a FRESH recipient address"; `app/src/App.tsx:420-421`, `Keypair.random()`).

**Tests.** `scripts/e2e.ts` asserts the fresh recipient's balance delta equals exactly the pot and that it never appears among the five funders. There is no circuit or contract test for unlinkability specifically — it follows from `recipient` being unconstrained, not from a proof property.

**Limits.**
- **Funding is fully public, by design.** All five `fund` calls carry `from.require_auth()` (`lib.rs:143-181`) and are visible on-chain, including in the `Circle.contributors` list (`lib.rs:45`). Sharibo only anonymizes the *claim* side; anyone can already see who funded a given round. Shielding funding is out of scope for this design (README "Honest limitations", roadmap).
- Unlinkability is a property of *how the demo uses* an unconstrained field, not a property the proof cryptographically guarantees. Nothing stops a future caller from passing a `recipient` that *is* a known funder, which would (correctly) not break anything, but also means the contract itself enforces no unlinkability — only the client's choice to mint a fresh address does.
- The relayer/observer risk described under "No double claim" above applies here too: whoever submits the transaction sees the plaintext `recipient` before it lands on-chain.

## Property → code → test matrix

| Property | Enforcing code | Test evidence | Known limit |
|---|---|---|---|
| Membership | `membership.template.circom:21-70,99-110`; `lib.rs:339-368` | `membership.test.js:74,86,92,116`; `test.rs:194,232` | vk not pinned on-chain; single-party setup |
| No double claim | `lib.rs:213-217,231` | `test.rs:284,548` | recipient not bound to proof (front-run/hijack risk) |
| Round binding | `identity.ts:63-90`; `lib.rs:207-211,325-331` | `test.rs:328`; `membership.test.js:98` | binding is on-chain equality, not an in-circuit constraint |
| Unlinkability | `lib.rs:236-237` (unconstrained `recipient`) | `scripts/e2e.ts` fresh-recipient assertions | funding side is fully public; admin relays the claim tx in the demo |

## Out of scope

- **Network-level linkage.** Correlating a claim transaction's submitter IP, RPC session, or wallet-provider metadata back to a specific member. Nothing in this repo's contract or circuit code defends against this; it would need to be addressed at the transport/relay layer (e.g., a genuinely third-party relayer network), which does not exist yet.
- **Timing correlation.** Inferring which member claimed from *when* a proof was generated or submitted relative to funding events. Not modeled or defended against.
- **Testnet-only status.** Every on-chain artifact referenced in the README is testnet, using native testnet XLM as the pot asset. Mainnet-specific risks (real fund custody, gas-market front-running economics, ceremony participation incentives) are not analyzed here — see [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md) Limitations and Exclusions.

## Verifying these claims

Run the suites the matrix above cites:

```bash
cd circuits && npm test        # circuit-level properties
cd contracts && cargo test     # contract-level properties (8/8)
npm run e2e                    # unlinkability + round-binding, against live testnet
```

If any of the referenced line numbers drift out of sync with the code during a refactor, that's a signal this document needs a follow-up edit, not that the property has changed.
